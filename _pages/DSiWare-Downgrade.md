title: "DSiWare Downgrade"
permalink: /dsiware-downgrade.html
---

If you are between versions 11.0.0 and 11.2.0, you must follow this guide to downgrade your NATIVE_FIRM using DSiWare and a second 3DS which has already has a Custom Firmware installed on it in order to dump and restore your NAND.
{: .notice}   

If you are below 11.2.0 on either device, then you should do the ctr-httpwn steps (when prompted) on each device under 11.2.0 to allow you to System Transfer with them.
{: .notice--info}

This takes advantage of an oversight which allows DSiWare titles to read and write anywhere in NAND.
{: .notice--info}

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).
{: .notice--info}

This guide will assume the CFW 3DS is running arm9loaderhax and was setup with this guide, but will work (with slight modifications such as doing all SysNAND steps on EmuNAND) on systems running an EmuNAND. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).
{: .notice--info}

{% capture notice-4 %}
This exploit requires you to [System Transfer](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13996/) from a CFW 3DS to a stock 3DS as part of the steps. System Transfers will work in the following directions *only*:
  + New 3DS -> New 3DS
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> Old 3DS or 2DS
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> New 3DS
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--warning">{{ notice-4 | markdownify }}</div>

Both systems MUST be from the same region.

3DS #1's NNID will be stuck on 3DS #2 unless you either system transfer back or call Nintendo! (details in the instructions)
{: .notice--danger}

System Transfers can only be performed once a week.

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Prep Work

1. Create a folder named `files9` on the root of **3DS #1**'s SD card if it does not already exist
2. **Use a [save manager](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM/releases/latest) to backup any saves you care about on 3DS #2 (it will be formatted!)**

##### Section III - steelhax

**This will allow you to enter the homebrew launcher after the System Transfer.**

1. Copy the `steelhax-installer` folder from the steelhax zip to the `/3ds/` folder on **3DS #1**'s SD card

10. Once you are in the homebrew launcher successfully, launch steelhax installer
11. Press (A) to continue
12. Press (A) to confirm **Steel Diver: Sub Wars**'s version
16. This time, change the version to match **3DS #2**'s system version
  + Even though you will be downgrading its firmware, you should still select the version it is on now
12. Copy _the contents of_ the `starter.zip` to the root of **3DS #2**'s SD card, then put the SD card back into **3DS #2**

##### Section IV - ctr-httpwn

**This section is only required if _3DS #2_ is under 11.2.0.**

**This will allow you to system transfer on versions other than the latest.**

8. Continue to the next section **without rebooting**
  + **3DS #2** has been temporarily patched to allow network functions (such as System Transfer) without running the latest system version
  + Keep in mind that exiting the System Settings will reboot the system
  + If the system is rebooted, you'll have to re-run ctr-httpwn before System Transfer will work

##### Section V - System Transfer

1. **Backup every file on both 3DS's SD cards to two separate folders on your computer (keep track of which is which)!**
2. Reinsert each SD card back into their corresponding 3DS
4. If **3DS #2** has a Nintendo Network ID on it, you must format the device using System Settings:
  + Go to the last page of "Other Settings" and select "Format System Memory", then follow all instructions
5. Read the following:
  + Your CFW 3DS = 3DS #1 = "Source System"
  + Your Stock 3DS = 3DS #2 = "Target System"
  + **Move DSiWare titles if prompted!**
  + Do **NOT** delete the source system's SD card contents if prompted
  + Make sure neither device's battery dies during the transfer
6. Go to [this link](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/227/) and follow Nintendo's official instructions for System Transferring from one system to another while keeping in mind what you just read

##### Section VI - Restoring 3DS #1

1. On **3DS #1**, complete initial setup
2. Do one of the following *(or neither if you don't mind __3DS #1__'s NNID being nonfunctional)*
    + Do the rest of the sections and then the full guide on **3DS #2**, then wait one week, then System Transfer from **3DS #2** back to **3DS #1** *(remember you cannot transfer back from a New 3DS to an Old 3DS)*
    + Call Nintendo and tell them you no longer have access to the device that your NNID is linked to (which is **3DS #2** in this case), and would like it linked to a different device (which is **3DS #1** in this case)
3. Reboot **3DS #1** while holding Start to launch Hourglass9
4. Go to SysNAND Backup/Restore and restore SysNAND from `NAND.bin`

##### Section VII - Backing up 3DS #2's firmware

1. Copy `boot.nds` to the root of **3DS #2**'s SD card
1. Create a folder named `dgTool` on the root of **3DS #2**'s SD card if it does not already exist
3. Copy the contents of the firmware zip to the `dgTool` folder on the root of **3DS #2**'s SD card
3. Launch your DSiWare game on **3DS #2**
4. Launch dgTool using your DSiWare game

5. Use dgTool to backup **3DS #2**'s firmware
  + New 3DS: select "Dump F0F1_N3DS.bin"
  + Old 3DS or 2DS: select "Dump F0F1_O3DS.bin"
6. Make note of the firmware backup's location
7. Exit dgTool
8. Put your SD card in your computer, then copy `F0F1_N3DS.bin` or `F0F1_O3DS.bin` (depending on your device) to a safe location; make backups in multiple locations; this backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong

##### Section VIII - Flashing 3DS #2's firmware

**Do NOT downgrade with dgTool on a device that already has arm9loaderhax installed or you will BRICK!**

1. Launch your DSiWare game on **3DS #2**
2. Launch dgTool using your DSiWare game

  + If either of these do not display the versions above, something has gone wrong and you should try again from the beginning

Continue to [Homebrew Launcher (No Browser)](homebrew-launcher-(no-browser)), using steelhax for your entrypoint instead of one of the ones listed.
{: .notice--primary}

**3DS #2**'s version number will *not* have changed in the settings.
{: .notice--info}

If, once transfered, steelhax only crashes to a black screen on **3DS #2**, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_steelhax).
{: .notice--warning}
