The Homebrew Launcher has many different entrypoints, or methods of launching. The most common is browserhax, but for devices that can't use it, this page has many alternative options.
{: .notice}

If you do not already own any of these games and do not have another 3DS that can access the Homebrew Launcher, the cheapest option is to buy a "Nintendo Selects" copy of Ocarina of Time 3D (ensure you get the correct cartridge for your region) and a [Powersaves](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IVJ1M7M) (compatible with all regions), then use oot3dhax from the chart below.
