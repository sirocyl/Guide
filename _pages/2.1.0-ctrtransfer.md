This section is only required for Old 3DS or 2DS. If you are on a New 3DS, skip to [Installing arm9loaderhax](installing-arm9loaderhax).
{: .notice--primary}

If you downgrade to 2.1.0 on a 2DS and left Wireless Communication off, you can re-enable the wireless by removing the battery for several seconds then booting back up.

Never format a 2DS while on a version <6.0.0 or you will be unable to complete initial setup and will BRICK!

#### Overview of steps

In this section, we will be flashing your console's [CTRNAND](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Flash_Filesystem#CTR_partition) partition to 2.1.0 in order to take advantage of an oversight in 2.1.0 for the purpose of extracting the [OTP](otp-info) unique to your console. This OTP file is required to install arm9loaderhax, and **cannot** be shared with other consoles.

This is accomplished by [installing a premade ctrtransfer image](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/4zhe4a/) containing 2.1.0, copying your console specific files (such as `moveable.sed` and `SecureInfo_A`) to it, then fixing the title databases.

The OTP is a requirement to use arm9loaderhax on the Old 3DS, while the New 3DS uses an exploit in the way keys are encrypted on the device in order to install arm9loaderhax without the OTP.

#### What you need

* You will need to have booted into Decrypt9
* The 2.1.0 ctrtransfer image for your device and region
